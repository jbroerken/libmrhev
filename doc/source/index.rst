libmrhev is an open source library which is serves as an easy way to add a way 
of communication between the various MRH platform components.

This documentation includes listings for the internal functions, enumerations, 
etc. used by the library itself. These are not meant to be used directly for 
service development but as information for library development.

As such, this documentation is both aimed at developers wanting to write their 
own user application service as well as library developers wishing to improve 
on the libmrhev source.
